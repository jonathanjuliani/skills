"""Structural checks for the jon-skills plugin. Run before committing.

Catches what silently breaks a skill pack: frontmatter that is not valid YAML
(an unquoted colon in a description is the recurring one), a name that does not
match its folder, a missing cross-tool manifest, a skill on disk that nobody
registered, a cross-reference to a skill that does not exist, and a relative
link to a reference file that has been renamed or removed.

Pass --links to also resolve external URLs. That is off by default because it
needs the network and can flake; the rest of the run is offline and fast.
