name: forms
description: Build a form that people can actually complete, covering labels, validation timing, error recovery, submit states, required fields, autofill, mobile input, and multi-step flows. Use when adding or changing any input, form, or checkout flow, or when users abandon a form, mistype into it, or lose what they typed.

# Forms

Get information out of a person and into the system without losing either the data or the person. Forms carry more failure modes per line of code than anything else in a UI, and most of them are decided in the first ten minutes of building one.

The defining constraint: the form's job is completion, not collection. Every field, every rule, and every validation moment is a place someone leaves, so each one has to earn its cost against the question "does the task fail without this". A form that collects perfect data from the third of people who finished it has not done its job.

## Ask for less

The cheapest fix for every problem below is the field that is not there.

- **Cut anything you do not act on.** A field nobody reads is pure abandonment with no upside. This is the YAGNI ladder applied to input: call the Skill tool with "create" for the general form of that argument.
- **Derive rather than ask.** Country from locale, city from postcode, currency from account. Ask only what cannot be inferred, and let the person correct the inference.
- **Split by obligation, not by tidiness.** Required now, optional now, later in settings. Anything that can wait should wait.
- **One column.** Side-by-side fields break the scan and are read in the wrong order more often than people expect. Pair only genuinely paired values, like expiry month and year.

## Label and describe

- **Every input has a real, persistent label.** A placeholder is not a label: it disappears exactly when the person needs it, takes the only description of the field with it, and is invisible to anyone reviewing a filled form.
- **Format guidance sits outside the input**, visible before typing and while typing. "DD/MM/YYYY" as placeholder text vanishes at the keystroke it was meant to guide.
- **Mark optional, not required**, when most fields are required. Marking every field with an asterisk carries no information.
- **The label says what the value is for**, in the domain's own words. Where a `CONTEXT.md` exists, its vocabulary wins.

## Validate at the right moment

Timing is most of the experience, and getting it wrong is the single most common form defect.

- **Never validate a field the person has not finished.** Marking an email invalid at the second character is the interface arguing with someone who is still typing.
- **Validate on blur, after the first interaction with that field.** Then, once a field has been marked invalid, revalidate as they type, so the error clears the moment it is fixed rather than at the next blur.
- **Validate on submit for everything**, including what the client cannot know.
- **Accept generously, normalise quietly.** Spaces in a card number, a phone number with or without the country code, a pasted value with trailing whitespace. Rejecting a format you could have parsed is the interface making its problem into theirs.
- **The client's rules and the server's are the same rules.** Share the schema rather than writing it twice: call the Skill tool with "api-design" for the contract, and "resolve-conventions" for the validation library. Two implementations drift, and the drift shows up as an error the form said would not happen.

## Fail without punishing

- **Never clear the form.** Losing typed input on a failed submit is the worst thing a form can do, and it is still common. Preserve everything, including what was invalid.
- **The message sits next to the field it concerns**, says what is wrong and what to do, and is associated with the input so a screen reader reaches it.
- **A summary at the top for a long form**, with each entry linking to its field, in addition to the per-field messages rather than instead of them.
- **Move focus to the first error** on a failed submit, so the person is not hunting.
- **Server errors land in the same place as client errors.** A person does not care which side rejected them.

## Submit exactly once

- **Disable on submit and say why**, with the button showing progress. Otherwise it is clicked three times and three records exist.
- **Make it idempotent on the server** anyway, because the network will retry and a double-submit will get through. Call the Skill tool with "api-design" for idempotency keys.
- **Confirm success visibly**, and say what happens next. A form that clears itself silently leaves people wondering whether it worked.
- **Guard against losing work** on navigation away from a long, dirty form.

## Meet the platform

- **Correct input types and `autocomplete` values.** These drive the mobile keyboard and the browser's autofill, and getting them right is close to free while getting them wrong makes a phone form miserable. A numeric field that raises a full alphabetic keyboard is a wrong input type.
- **Never block paste.** Especially on passwords and codes; it defeats password managers and prevents nothing.
- **Native controls first.** A native date input, select, or file picker brings keyboard support, mobile behaviour and accessibility for free. Replace one only when a real requirement forces it, and then own everything it was giving you.
- **The form works with the keyboard alone**, submits on Enter from a text input, and shows focus at every step.

## Multi-step

- **Show where they are and how much is left.** An unbounded flow reads as endless.
- **Persist between steps**, so back does not destroy the previous answers, and a reload does not restart the flow.
- **Validate each step at its own boundary**, not everything at the end.
- **Review before anything irreversible**, showing what will happen with a way back to change it.

## Rules

- **Fewer fields beats better fields.** Every one is a place someone stops.
- **The label never disappears.** Placeholders are hints, never names.
- **Never destroy typed input.** No exception is worth it.
- **One schema, both sides.** Client validation is a convenience layer over the server's rules, never a second set of them.
- **Native before custom.** A rebuilt control starts by losing everything the platform gave you.

## Excuses that do not hold

| Excuse | Why it fails |
| --- | --- |
| "The placeholder is clear enough as a label" | It is clear until they click, which is the moment they need it. It also fails review, autofill and screen readers |
| "We validate on the server, so the client can be loose" | Then the person finds out after submitting, having waited, and often having lost the input |
| "It is a strict format, so we reject anything else" | You could have parsed the spaces out. Every rejected-but-parseable value is an abandonment you chose |
| "One more field is not much" | Each field measurably costs completion, and this is the reasoning that produced the form nobody finishes |

## When this does not apply

A single search input, a toggle, and an inline edit of one value are not forms in this sense. Reach for this at anything with several fields, anything that submits to a server, and anything a person could abandon partway.

Where the project has a form library and an established pattern, follow it. Consistency across forms matters more than any single improvement here, since people learn one form and expect the next.

## Before you hand it over

Fill the form in as a hostile user: submit it empty, submit it half-complete, paste into every field, get one field wrong and fix it, submit twice fast, and complete it with the keyboard alone. Then check the three that survive most often: input lost on a failed submit, a placeholder doing a label's job, and validation firing while the person is still typing.
